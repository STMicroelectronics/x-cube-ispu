## 1 - Introduction

This ISPU example implements the magnetometer calibration.

The accelerometer is configured in high-performance mode at 52 Hz.

The magnetometer (LIS2MDL) is connected through the sensor-hub interface and it is configured in high-performance mode at 50 Hz. The sensor-hub configuration to apply is provided in the *output* folder as a separate file and must be loaded before the example main configuration.

The MotionMC library is provided as binary in the *ispu/lib* folder.

The outputs are as follows:

* Calibrated magnetometer x-axis [uT/50] as float mapped starting from ISPU_DOUT_00_L (10h)
* Calibrated magnetometer y-axis [uT/50] as float mapped starting from ISPU_DOUT_02_L (14h)
* Calibrated magnetometer z-axis [uT/50] as float mapped starting from ISPU_DOUT_04_L (18h)
* Magnetometer x-axis offset [uT/50] as float mapped starting from ISPU_DOUT_06_L (1Ch)
* Magnetometer y-axis offset [uT/50] as float mapped starting from ISPU_DOUT_08_L (20h)
* Magnetometer z-axis offset [uT/50] as float mapped starting from ISPU_DOUT_10_L (24h)
* Magnetometer calibration level as uint8_t mapped starting from ISPU_DOUT_12_L (28h)
  * 0 is *unknown*
  * 1 is *poor*
  * 2 is *good*
  * 3 is *best*


The calibration procedure requires rotating the device for acquiring magnetometer samples at different orientations.


## 2 - Device orientation

None.


## 3 - Interrupts

The configuration generates an interrupt on INT1 when the calibrated magnetometer for the new sample is computed and available in the output registers.
