## 1 - Introduction

This ISPU example implements the man-down solution based on the fusion of the accelerometer and pressure sensor data.

The accelerometer is configured in low-power mode at 104 Hz.

The pressure sensor (LPS22HH) is connected through the sensor-hub interface and it is configured in low-power mode at 10 Hz. The sensor-hub configuration to apply is provided in the *output* folder as a separate file and must be loaded before the example main configuration.

The MotionMD library is provided as binary in the *ispu/lib* folder.

The outputs are as follows:

* Accelerometer x-axis [g] as float mapped starting from ISPU_DOUT_00_L (10h)
* Accelerometer y-axis [g] as float mapped starting from ISPU_DOUT_02_L (14h)
* Accelerometer z-axis [g] as float mapped starting from ISPU_DOUT_04_L (18h)
* Pressure [hPa] as float mapped starting from ISPU_DOUT_06_L (1Ch)
* Man-down event (1 if the user has fallen) as uint8_t mapped starting from ISPU_DOUT_08_L (20h)


## 2 - Device orientation

None.


## 3 - Interrupts

The configuration generates an interrupt on INT1 when the man-down event for the new sample is computed and available in output registers.
