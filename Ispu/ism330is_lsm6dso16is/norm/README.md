## 1 - Introduction

This ISPU example implements the computation of the norm of the three axes of the accelerometer, configured in high-performance mode at 26 Hz.

The outputs are as follows:

* Accelerometer x-axis [LSB] as int16_t mapped starting from ISPU_DOUT_00_L (10h)
* Accelerometer y-axis [LSB] as int16_t mapped starting from ISPU_DOUT_01_L (12h)
* Accelerometer z-axis [LSB] as int16_t mapped starting from ISPU_DOUT_02_L (14h)
* Accelerometer norm [LSB] as float mapped starting from ISPU_DOUT_03_L (16h)


## 2 - Device orientation

None.


## 3 - Interrupts

The configuration generates an interrupt on INT1 when the norm for the new sample is computed and available in output registers.
