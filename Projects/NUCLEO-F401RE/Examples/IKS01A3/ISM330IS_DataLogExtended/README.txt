@par Example Description

Main function is to show how to use ISPU device in sensor expansion board to send data from a Nucleo board
using UART to a connected PC with the Unicleo-GUI Utility.

To run the application, it is needed to install and launch the Unicleo-GUI on the PC.
The Unicleo-GUI is available on https://www.st.com/content/st_com/en/products/development-tools/software-development-tools/sensor-software-development-tools/unicleo-gui.html

After connection has been established:
  - the user can view the data from various on-board environmental sensors like Temperature, Humidity, and Pressure
  - the user can view data from ISPU and other on-board inertial sensors like Accelerometer, Gyroscope and Magnetometer
  - the user can upload predefined json/ucf pairs of files to ISPU device
  - the user can also visualize this data as graphs

@par Keywords

ISPU, MEMS, I2C, VCOM

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32 Nucleo device with ISPU sensor in expansion board (X-NUCLEO-IKS01A3)
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics:
    - NUCLEO-F401RE RevC board
    - NUCLEO-L476RG RevC board

@par How to use it?

This package contains projects for 3 IDEs: IAR, Keil ï¿½Vision and STM32CubeIDE. In order to make the
program work, you must do the following:
  - WARNING: before opening the project with any toolchain be sure your folder
    installation path is not too in-depth since the toolchain may report errors
    after building.
  - Open STM32CubeIDE or alternatively the Keil uVision toolchain or the IAR toolchain.
  - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory.
  - Run the example.
  - Alternatively, you can download the pre-built binaries in "Binary"
    folder included in the distributed package.

@par Note

This example has been generated by STM32CubeMX using generic ISPU_DataLogExtended job which creates files with the
"custom_" preffix even if user would expect "iks01a3_" preffix. This is done for purpose for technical reasons and it
is not feasible to do it differently at the moment.
After the generation it's recommended to replace "CUSTOM" by "IKS01A3" in bsp_ip_conf.h file in order to make
Unicleo-GUI diplay the correct HW picture.
